In this project, I used Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, Jinja, and a Javascript library called FullCalendar.

Like in the Finance pset, I made sure to differentiate between get and post methods. It was especially important to use post for security reasons when users were passing confidential information, like the passwords recorded in `Create Group`, `Change Password`, `Log in`, `Register`, `Join Group`. Even other less confidential forms like in `Add Events`, `Delete Events`, `Leave Group`, `See Groupmates` used get only to reach the page and used post when submitting forms for differentiation. 

It was also important for me to implement alerts or error warnings, both preemptive and subsequestial ones. One alert is for `Add Events` which states that characters ', ", \, & are not allowed. This decision came from the fact that these four characters always escaped when displayed on calendar. Moreover, specifically for ' and ", they are being used to split strings when deleting events, so having them in the event title would lead to confusion. In addition to the alerts, if the user does not follow this rule and tries to make the event, they get an error message. Another similar alert is for registeration. The user is alerted at the beginning to not include ' in their username. This is because later in function `groupmates` in app.py, the username of the groupmate (a.k.a get_groupmate) is split by the character ' for parsing. Therefore, having ' in the username leads to confusion. Similar to the previous example, if the user accidentally enters ' despite the alert warning, they will receive an error message. Other alerts are purely informational, like letting the user know that they have no events (in `Delete Events`), letting the user know that leaving the group as its last member also entails deleting the group itself (in `Manage Events` when the user is in a group), and letting the user know that they are the only one in a group (in `See groupmates`). Most other error message were implemented to avoid blank statements for all required fields in a form. Other errors were implemented when the user accidentally provided nonsensical/illogical information, like the start date in `Add Events` coming after the end date, or the start time coming after the end time for a single-day event. 

I also implemented flashes after some kind of change was recorded to let the user know that the changes were successful. 

It is notable that there is an `index` function in app.py but no index.html. Instead there is a calendar.html. This was a specific design decision that I made to prevent repetition, and the name calendar.html highlights its functionality and its general use. Because I use the calendar template for both the homepage of the webpage (a.k.a. the user's own calendar) and for displaying the calendar of the user's groupmates, it made sense to have a single calendar template named calendar.html instead of index.html and groupmate-calendar.html separately. I also made a function in app.py called `calendar` that took the `user_id` of the calendar's owner as an input and returned the list of events and their relevant information. This function was used both in creating the homepage controlled by function `index` in app.py and in displaying groupmate's calendar controlled by function `groupmates` in app.py that both passed calendar.html in `render_template`. 

I created three tables in calendar.db: `users`, `groups`, `events`. The table `users` stored the user's `id` as PRIMARY KEY, `username`, `hash` (hashed password), and `group_id`. `group_id` is not NULL because that's an optional information. The table `groups` stored the group's `id` as PRIMARY KEY, `groupname`, and `hash` (hashed password). Because the `group_id`in `users` is associated with `id` in table `groups`, it is easy to cross-reference information. Finally, table `events` stored event's `id` as PRIMARY KEY, `user_id`, `title`, `start`, `end`, `time`, and `color`. The categories `start` and `end` displayed start and end times as a string with extra characters that were required by the FullCalendar library to render and display events properly. Meanwhile, the category `time` stored both the start and end time as a single string without the extra characters so that the display was user-friendly. `time` was created so that in `Delete Events`, the displayed times in the dropdown menu were readable. The `color` category is not NULL because it is optional. In `Add Events`, the user can create events without selecting a color because the default is always blue. However, if the user does choose a color from the dropdown menu, that information is reflected in the table `events`. With these three tables, different information were easily crossreferenced and accessible through SQL queries in app.py. 

When creating the group feature in my web application, I tried to mimick the design of username-user_id pair as much as possible. Therefore, I had both groupname and group_id, and I saved the group_id in both the proper SQL tables and in session for consistency and easy access throughout the application. 

Another feature that I would like to highlight is the manage-group.html. When the user clicks on `Manage Group` in the menu, depending on whether the user is in a group or not, the user is directed to different pages. I implemented this feature by creating a dummy html page called manage-group.html that has no content. Its only purpose is for me to create a corresponding `manageGroup` function in app.py that checks if the user is in a group or not. If the user is in a group, the function redirects them to another html page called leave-group.html to give them an option to leave. Otherwise, they are redirected to join-group.html to enter the groupname and password to join a group. Because I decided that it was best for the user to only be a part of one group at a time for simplicity, having manage-group redirect the user to either leave or join group pages was a more elegant solution than to have two separate menu tabs at the top.
